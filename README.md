# Classifier

Mr. Rabbits (Our intelligent agent created by Brian Luu) will guide the user to a classifier test.

The program specifically asks to choose between the two data sets, Fisher's iris flower (iris.csv) and Wisconsin breast cancer
diagnostics (wdbc_clean.csv).

Then it asks which method to use to classfy data, with what percentage of data as the training sample and as the testing sample.
The three methods available are: K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Bagging.
